Greetings, I am Matthew Dunsdon and I work as a software developer in Bristol, UK.  In my life so far I have had many opportunities to work on software projects.  This website therefore serves as a platform for me to document:

1. Contributions to open source software
1. Previous project work
 * _i.e. personal, academic and commercial_
1. Plans for software development in the future
1. My values and priorities for my life and where work fits in
