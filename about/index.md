My name is Matthew Dunsdon. I have a passion for solving problems and am interested in how technology is impacting our culture - in education, healthcare, data privacy, house devices, etc.

When I am not thinking about technology I am exploring Bristol on foot, flying my power kite and actively participating as member of my local church.  I also enjoy going on coastal walks when on holiday with my family.

Since 2002, my choice to become a Christian as been my own choice, for I was brought up my Christian parents.  I appreciate the opportunities I have to attend church, weekly small group meetings and to bless the community.

My interest in Software Development came from spending time with my grandfather, who was using VBA in excel to solve problems for himself.  As a 10 year old, I started to use VBA myself and came across Visual Basic (VB) 6 and VB.Net as time went on.  I had a strong mathematical, problem solving and creative background which lead me to study Computer Science (masters) at Bristol University.

I work as a Software Developer in Bristol.  As I have gained commercial software development experience I have learnt to value the business, developer and open source concerns associated with software development.
