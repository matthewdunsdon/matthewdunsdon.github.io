## Objectives

* Reads in camera and shape descriptions.
* For each pixel calculate its colour using a ray trace.
* Produces ppm images.


## Approach Taken

To implement this I made use of the class and inheritance structure exposed in C++. In order to make the process run faster, a bounding volume hierarchy was implemented.


## Learning Outcomes

Gained experience with using inheritance in C++.
