## Objectives

* Use Genetic Algorithms to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) optimisation problem.
* Use Q-learning agent (Reinforcement Learning algorithm) to learn to play tic-tac-toe against random agent


## Approach Taken

1. Implemented code to run learning algorithms
1. Implemented code to put results to file, so performance can be graphed.
1. Explored parameters for algorithms and used graphs to compare performance.


## Learning Outcomes

From this project, I gained a better understanding the value of measuring metrics.
