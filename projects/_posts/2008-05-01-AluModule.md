layout: bare
languages: [Verilog]
title: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
---

## Objectives

* Understand how a ALU performs numerical operations

## Approach Taken

In this project I implemented:

1. 1-bit and 8-bit adder using gates (AND, XOR, OR and NOT).
1. 8-bit adder / substractor using gates.
1. 8-bit equality and less-than checker using gates.
1. Tests code to validate the behaviour of components.
1. ALU component that supported multiplication and shifts (left and right).

## Learning Outcomes

* Developed a understanding how to describe systems in languages like Verilog.
* Gained an appreciation of using tests to provide fast feedback for the  behaviour of a system.
