## Objectives

* Read input for basic assembly code.
* Generate machine code.
* _[Optional] Include supports for labels._
* _[Optional] Ensure it can assemble a Fibonacci program._


## Approach Taken

1. Read input file and parse an assembly language
1. Ensure errors and warnings are managed
1. Output machine code based upon input file
1. Include support for forwards and backward reference labels

## Learning Outcomes

Had the opportunity to learn how to implement and use a more advanced data-structure (Red Black tree) for storing error and link information - to enable the assembler scale better when given large assembly files.
